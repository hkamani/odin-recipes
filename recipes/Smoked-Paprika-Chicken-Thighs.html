    <h3>Smoked Paprika Chicken Thighs</h3>
    <p> Bring a light, smoky flavor to your oven-roasted chicken thighs without having to grill outdoors. The deep flavors pair well with a cucumber salad or garlic rice.</p>

            <li>½ teaspoon ancho chile powder</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>                
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
            <li>4 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>

        <h4>Steps (as taken from <a href ="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8544439/smoked-paprika-chicken-thighs/">allrecipes</a> ) <a/></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>In a large resealable storage bag, combine paprika, garlic, ancho chile powder, salt, turmeric, and black pepper; add olive oil and apple cider vinegar and mix together. Place chicken thighs into the bag, reseal, and massage seasoning mix into chicken. Marinate, refrigerated, for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in the prepared baking dish and drizzle with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink inside and the skin is crispy, about 40 minutes, brushing occasionally with the pan drippings. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thick part of a thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). For extra crispy skin, place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
